This repository contains the code for the preprint
[arXiv:2509.22090](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22090)
(doi: [10.48550/arXiv.2509.22090](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.22090)).

## System requirements

- Installation of MATLAB is required. The use of MATLAB 2019b or later is recommended.
- Although the characterization pipeline can be run on a CPU, the use of a GPU with at least 8 GB of dedicated memory is recommended to speed up the Rayleigh integral computations.
- To run the code on GPU, the Parallel Computing Toolboxâ„¢ from MATLAB is required.


## Installation

### Repository

Clone the current repository with git.
```
git clone https://github.com/NathanBlanken/transducer-characterization.git
```

### PROTEUS acoustic module

This repository depends on the latest functionality from the acoustic module of the PROTEUS toolbox.
This functionality currently exists in the branch
[`transducer-calibration`](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS/tree/transducer-calibration) of the PROTEUS repository.
This branched will be merged with the
[main](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS) branch in the next version of PROTEUS.

1. Clone PROTEUS with git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS.git
   ```

3. On your computer, switch to the branch `transducer-calibration`:
   ```
   git checkout transducer-calibration
   ```

**Note:** a [full](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-of-the-simulator)
installation of PROTEUS, including k-Wave, geometry data, flow solver, and vtkToolbox, is **not** required
if you are only going use it for transducer characterization.

**Note (optional):** installation of [k-Wave](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS?tab=readme-ov-file#k-wave) is required
if you intend to reproduce Fig. 2 or Fig. 8 of the arXiv preprint.

**Note (optional):** the branch `transducer-calibration` of the PROTEUS repository introduces the function [`update_sensor_fast`](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS/blob/transducer-calibration/acoustic-module/update_sensor_fast.m), which is an upgrade of [`update_sensor`](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS/blob/transducer-calibration/acoustic-module/update_sensor.m). To unlock the full potential of this new function, increase the value of `maxMemory` to a higher value that is still supported by your system's RAM. See [`demos`](demos) for further details.

### Path variables

After installation of PROTEUS, navigate back to the current repository ([`transducer-characterization`](.)).

Modify the variable `PATHS.AcousticModule` in the file [`path_setup_characterization.m`](path_setup_characterization.m)
to match the location of the PROTEUS acoustic module on your computer.
```
PATHS.AcousticModule = '/home/user/PROTEUS/acoustic-module'; % Replace by your own path
```

To add all required directories to the MATLAB path, run the file from the MATLAB command window:
```
path_setup_characterization
```
To remove those directories again, run:
```
path_setup_characterization('rmpath')
```


### Experimental data

Download the experimental data of the P4-1 transducer from
[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17095584)
to the folder `data`.

With this experimental data, you will be able to reproduce all results in the arXiv preprint.
Reproducing these results is recommended as a tutorial.

**Note:** the folder `PROTEUS-I` only needs to be downloaded,
if you want to reproduce Fig. 8 of the arXiv preprint.
This folder contains the data from Fig. 4 of [PROTEUS Part I](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597664).

- ðŸ“‚ `data` Experimental data.

  These demonstrations correspond to Section II of the arXiv preprint.
- ðŸ“‚ [`figures`](figures) Figure formatting scripts used for the figures in the arXiv preprint.
  The readme in this folder contains an overview of how each figure was generated.

### Demonstration of the full characterization pipeline

The script [`main_pipeline.m`](main_pipeline.m) in the root directory is
a demonstration of the full characterization pipeline.
It is an implementation of Fig. 4 in the arXiv preprint.
The other functions in the root folder are called by `main_pipeline.m` and
correspond to one or multiple steps in Fig. 4.

The file `main_pipeline.m` returns the transmit and receive impulse responses
and the transducer properties in a format that can be directly loaded into PROTEUS.
See [TransducerGUI](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS/blob/main/documentation/TransducerGUI.md).

For the an interactive experience of the demonstration in `main_pipeline.m`,
it is recommended to use the checkpoints in the file,
which allow you to run one part of the pipeline at a time.
Run `help main_pipeline.m` for further details.

### Other demonstrations

If you are not so familiar with the theory presented in Section II of the arXiv preprint,
you are encouraged to check out the demos in [`demos`](demos) first.

### Coordinate system

The tools in this repository use a Cartesian coordinate system with the *z*-axis pointing along the axis of propagation.
By contrast, PROTEUS currently uses a Cartesian coordinate system with *x*-axis pointing along the axis of propagation.
The folder `utilities` contains tools for switching smoothly between the two systems.
See [`demos`](demos) for further information.

### Applying the pipeline to new transducer characterization data

Note that `main_pipeline.m` is a prototype framework, not an out-of-the-box tool
for transducer characterization.
Applying `main_pipeline.m` to new data requires fine-tuning of the computational steps,
in particular the parameters at the top of each of these files:
 - `compute_receive_impulse_response.m`
 - `determine_scan_plane_orientation.m`
 - `determine_virtual_receiver_orientation.m`
 - `estimate_model_parameters.m`

The pipeline was demonstrated on a transducer with a flat, rectangular aperture.
Applying the pipeline the pipeline to an arbitrary transducer geometry will require more substantial modification of the code.

For example, to find the radius of curvature for a curved transducer, `estimate_model_parameters.m` has to be modified.
Subsequently, the file `rayleigh_propagation` has to be modified to set up curved source/sensor structures.

For transducers with a non-rectangular aperture, `determine_scan_plane_orientation.m` has to be modified.
(This involves merely a simplification in the case of a circular aperture.)

Nonetheless, the tools in ðŸ“‚ `rayleigh-integral` are already fully compatible with an arbitrary geometry.

### Preparing hydrophone data in the correct format

Hydrophone scan data must be stored as a three-dimensional array with dimensions Nx-by-Ny-by-Nsamples,
where Nx-by-Ny is the size of the size of the scan grid and the third dimension corresponds to the time-domain hydrophone voltage data.

Additionally,
a MATLAB structure `medium`, with fields `sound_speed` and `density`, and
a MATLABstructure `Grid` in [PROTEUS format](https://github.com/PROTEUS-SIM/PROTEUS/blob/main/acoustic-module/define_grid.m) must be provided.

Compare your data format to the data format in `Transmit.mat` from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17095584).

**Note for collaborators at the University of Twente:**
Collaborators acquiring data with the [calibration setup](https://github.com/NathanBlanken/calibration-setup) at the Physics of Fluids group
can use the script [`reorganize_data`](utilities/reorganize_data.m)
to convert the experimental data to the correct format.
